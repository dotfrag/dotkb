Hi, I'm dotfrag, a Linux enthusiast currently working as a DevOps engineer.

I created this site to write about the things I'm learning and want to remember
in the future. It is a hybrid between a blog and a personal knowledge base.

The main focus is on short and concise technical information. While this site
does not contain any rocket-science information, basic knowledge is assumed.
